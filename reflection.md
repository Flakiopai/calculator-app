# ðŸ§® Project Reflection: Simple Calculator

## ðŸ§© What I Built
- A functional web calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- It handles basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- The display updates with each button click and shows the final result

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
- How to update input fields dynamically using JavaScript
- How to structure button interactions with `onclick` events
- How to use `eval()` safely to compute expressions

## ðŸš§ What Was Tricky
- Connecting all buttons to the right logic functions
- Handling deletion and clear actions properly
- Keeping the UI layout clean and intuitive

## âœ¨ Things Iâ€™m Proud Of
- I created my first working JavaScript app!
- The calculator responds instantly and feels responsive
- Code is clean and organized across three files

## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™d Like to Improve
- Add keyboard support for number entry and operations
- Create an error message for invalid expressions
- Style the calculator to look more like a real one

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next
- Build the To-Do List App to learn localStorage and list management
- Explore dynamic UI updates and more advanced input handling
