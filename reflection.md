# ðŸ§® Project Reflection: Simple Calculator

## ðŸ§© What I Built

- A web-based calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Supports basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- The display updates in real time with each button press and shows the final result

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- How to dynamically update input fields using JavaScript
- How to connect buttons to functions using `onclick` events
- How to evaluate math expressions safely using JavaScriptâ€™s Function constructor

## ðŸš§ Challenges I Faced

- Mapping each button to the correct logic function
- Handling edge cases like deleting the last character or clearing the display
- Designing a clean, intuitive layout that works on different screen sizes

## âœ¨ What Iâ€™m Proud Of

- This is my first fully functional JavaScript app!
- The calculator responds quickly and works smoothly
- My code is clean, well-organized, and split across HTML, CSS, and JS files

## ðŸ”§ Accessibility Improvements

- Added ARIA labels for screen reader support
- Enabled full keyboard navigation and visible focus styles
- Ensured color contrast and touch target sizes meet accessibility standards

## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™d Like to Improve

- Add keyboard shortcuts for number entry and operations
- Display clearer error messages for invalid input
- Style the calculator to resemble a physical calculator more closely

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next

- Build a To-Do List App to learn about localStorage and dynamic list management
- Explore more advanced UI interactions and accessibility best practices
